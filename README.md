### Project Description: 
Our project will allow current and future Stuyvesant students to monitor all of the school’s 14 escalators in real time. This was attempted before but only lasted about a week or so. We want to make an improved version of it that will actually be a useful resource for students. 

### How to Use: 
The website will display images representing each of Stuy’s 14 escalators. If the escalator is operating, the image will be green and if it is broken, it will be red.
