## Title: 
Stuy Escalator Monitoring System

[Our website](206.189.227.109) (<-- we tried to follow the steps listed in the tutorial but still didn't get it to work :( it just directs us to the default Ubuntu homepage)

### Project Description: 
Our project will allow current and future Stuyvesant students to monitor all of the school’s 14 escalators in real time. This was attempted before but only lasted about a week or so. We want to make an improved version of it that will actually be a useful resource for students. 

### How to Use: 
The website will display images representing each of Stuy’s 14 escalators. If the escalator is operating, the image will be green and if it is broken, it will be red.
